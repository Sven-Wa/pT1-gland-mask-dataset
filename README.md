# pT1-gland-mask-dataset
This Dataset contains images and masks of colorectal glands collected from 16 hematoxylin and eosin stained Whole slide images of 16 different pT1 colorectal cancer patients.
The datasets was created for my master thesis to train deep neural networks to segment intestinal glands. The subset folder contains different subset of pT1-gland-mask-dataset which were used for fine-tuning experiment during my master thesis.

The Glands were annotated by my self using the whole slide image viewer ASAP.
A script for creating image patches and masks from WSI in ASAP can be found here:
